Tiny Obj Loader is required to be downloaded and placed in the main project directory to load OBJ file(s) - https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader

The OBJ loader is something I can reccomend BTW - really reliable and follows the newer standart - so do not use blender 2.79 .obj export (of the old format), since the wavefront would export wrong 

I also used Nuget to get the DXTool kit for the texture loader...
